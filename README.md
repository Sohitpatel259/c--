# C++ Projects

This repository contains my C++ work, including various projects, exercises, and code samples. Each folder or file demonstrates different aspects of C++ programming, such as algorithms, data structures, and application development.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the code, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).

```sh
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

## Folder Structure

- `src/` - Source code files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `examples/` - Sample programs

## Contributing
